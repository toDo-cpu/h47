# Heap-47

## What is Heap-47

Heap-47 or abreviated h47 is an gdb extension to enhance the debugging of the heap during exploitation. Common extensions like `pwndbg` or `gef` already provide some tools to visualize the heap and inspect chunk but Heap-47 will do more.

## Development

### Objectives

 - bootstrap the project
 - create a mature gdb extension
    - basic function to read/write memory
    - resolve symbols during runtime
    - define commands
 - implement `ptmalloc`
 - release v1.0.0
